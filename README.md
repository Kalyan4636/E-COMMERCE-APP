# E-COMMERCE-APP 

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: a Simple E-Commerce Web App! ðŸ›’

I've created a basic e-commerce webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a small project, perfect for beginners who want to get hands-on with web development.

# Check it out live: Simple E-Commerce

ðŸ‘‰ Features:

1. Display products with names and prices
2. Add products to the cart (with a placeholder alert)
3. Feel free to clone the code and play around with it on your own! This is just a starting point, and there's plenty of room to expand and enhance. ðŸ’¡
